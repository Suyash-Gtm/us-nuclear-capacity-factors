# U.S. Nuclear Fleet Capacity Factor Dashboard

📊 A data-driven exploration of monthly nuclear reactor performance across the United States, spanning 30+ years.  
☢️ Built as part of my data science bootcamp capstone, with real-world relevance to advanced reactor deployment strategies.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This notebook tracks and visualizes **monthly capacity factors**—a key metric reflecting the operational efficiency of nuclear reactors. Using official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), it highlights long-term trends, seasonal outages, and systemic improvements in the fleet.

✅ **Dataset**: `nuclear_energy_overview_eia.csv` (public, parsed from EIA archive)  
✅ **Years covered**: 1994–2024  
✅ **Metrics visualized**: Monthly capacity factor, rolling averages

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Capacity factor is a core benchmark for evaluating nuclear asset performance, especially in contexts where high uptime is critical—such as Deep Fission’s underground SMR deployments or microreactor pilots like SteelHeart’s Yoroi roadmap.

This project aims to:
- Translate raw operational data into strategic insights
- Help next-gen nuclear innovators benchmark fleet-level performance
- Lay the groundwork for future dashboards that incorporate generation output, capacity expansion, and reactor-level diagnostics

## 📈 Sample Visuals

- 📆 Line chart of U.S. capacity factor (1994–2024)
- 🔁 Rolling 12-month average to smooth seasonal variation
- 📌 Annotatable structure for future events (e.g. uprates, retirements)

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- Integrate per-reactor analysis and historical outage flags
- Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit or Dash)
- Overlay nuclear’s share of total grid output for contextual framing
- Add milestone annotations (e.g. Deep Fission’s founding, new NRC licenses)
